      </p>My name is Lisa, and I am a full-stack developer currently based in Toronto. Prior to entering tech, I worked extensively as a collaborative pianist. I am continuing to discover many fascinating connections between the worlds of web development and music. For example, in my musical career I was often asked to play music on the spot in rehearsals (aka "sight-read") and learn difficult classical repertoire on short notice for performances. Those occasions, while sometimes stressful, provided challenges that I was consistently able to meet. I always enjoyed having an opportunity to learn something new! My musical life also brought me into contact with many personalities at all phases of development, from student musicians auditioning for university to singers at the Metropolitan Opera. In every project, it was my goal to not only play my best but in doing so, to make every musician sound like a star. Thanks for having a look at these samples. Please don't hesitate to get in touch if you would like to discuss any of these applications and more.</p>

            <p>Taskinator is a simple Kanban style application. Users enter a task name into a form field and then click on the adjacent dropdown to give it a label. Pressing on "Add Task" automatically moves the task into a "Tasks To Do" column. From there, the user can move the task into the "Tasks In Progress" or "Tasks Completed" columns, as appropriate.</p>

          <p>Robot Gladiators is an entry-level game using vanilla JavaScript and pop-ups. The user is prompted to give their robot a name, which can lose or gain health points at random and purchase items in a store while fighting other robots. The game is finished when only one robot has health points remaining (above 0) and all others have exited the fight loop.</p>
